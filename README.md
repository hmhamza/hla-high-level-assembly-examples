### 1. sumInputs
Write a program named sumInputs (in a file named sumInputs.hla) that reads a list (see hints section below) of positive numbers from the user until the user enters zero. Display the sum of the positive integers read. All the values you read from the user and manipulate in the program must be unsigned 8-bit integer quantities (use getu8()). You may assume all inputs are less than 256.
